1. Move the reference DB building outside de loop so it is not needed to build it each time
2. For fragmented genomes, check when looking for synteny if the next gene is at the start/end of a contig (+/- X positions) and account for it, instead of just following the order of contigs.
	Based on the observation for ACBA.007, which has 1657 genomes and if using synteny, only 2 genes remain in the core-genome.
