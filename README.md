# gembase-core
## v.00

this is a repo to store the package gembase-core, a set of scripts orbitting around the "gembase" format, originally ideated by Eduardo Rocha, which I have adopted since my time at Rocha lab. 

I will make evolve this README as I start adding scripts and making them work in this environment.

2025.06.05. I decided that I am converting my scripts to build the gembase + build the core-genome & the pan-genome to python, with the help of MissGPT.
